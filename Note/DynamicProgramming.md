Steps
When developing a dynamic-programming algorithm, we follow a sequence of four steps:
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.

When to use DP/ Categories?
When recursion alone O(2^n) won’t work

•	Optimization 达到这个目的最少需要多少步

Difference between DP and recursion with memorization

Requirements for DP
1.	Optimal substructure 最优化原理（最优子结构性质）
“can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems”
2.	Overlapping sub-problems 子问题的重叠性
Sub-problems are overlapped such that we can compute only once and store the solution for future use
Reduce time time complexity (Exponential to polynomial)
If sub-problems do not overlap -> divide and conquer
3.	No-after effect 无后效性
The optimal solution of a subproblem will not change when it was used to solve a bigger problem optimally

Top-down: recursion with memorization
Bottom-up: DP

Algorithms that use DP
Fibonacci sequence 
Longest common subsequence
Knapsack
Floyd-Warshall
Bellman-Ford

Tip: 
Paddings required to handle out of board cases. Actual indies start from 1 instead of 0.
